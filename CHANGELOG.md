## CHANGELOG
* Changed flavour to match the rewards better and generally cleaned up to read better.
* Added a host of new icons now I have access to more icons. Gave Kostatltyn missing icons.
* Made modifications to some .lua files to standardise red text, etc.
* Cleared up some mission text that had confusing objectives for the player.
* Swapped around Kostatltyn route 3 rewards that were in the wrong place. (Port income comes from Marienburg now, not Altdorf)












NOTES BELOW
Changed following subfactions' reward icons with better choices:
Greasus
Grimgor
Kostaltyn

Changed flavour text for Kostaltyn to better match the titles and effects.



The Ice Queen will lead our mighty nation into ruin with her dangerous magicks. She'd already be screaming on a pyre if she did not share the Red Tzar's blood. Nevertheless, Kostaltyn must act. If we win the support of the people, the Tzarina will have no choice but to relenquish her frozen grip on these lands.

\\n\\nMaintain control of the following settlements either by direct ownership or through [[img:icon_vassal]][[/img]]vassals and [[img:icon_military_alliance]][[/img]]military allies:

ROUTE 1 REWARD:
Dethroned
The Ice Queen's ruinous leadership will lead Kislev astray no longer. The Motherland is stronger for it.

ROUTE 2 REWARD:
The Supreme Patriarch knows without a shadow of a doubt that the only thing that stands between his people and annihilation is faith. A bright reflection of the dark sorcerers and champions of Chaos, he sees the land around him and Ursun as what he must protect and serve.

Ice Court Defectors
Where Katarin failed, Kostaltyn succeeded. Recognising the true power of the Great Orthodoxy, several Ice Witches have deserted their queen and joined their strength to Kostaltyn's, wreathing his warriors in frozen armour and battering invaders with ceaseless blizzards. The Supreme Patriarch yearns to have the heathens executed on cleansing pyres, but stays his hand, for now...

The Old World is rife with corruption, blasphemy, and the worship of lesser gods. Tear down the Temple of Sigmar, disperse the Cult of Ulric, beggar the followers of Handrich! Ursun, Tor, Dazh, Salyak â€“ these are the true gods who will guide the realms of men out of chaos, no others!\\n\\nMaintain control of the following settlements either by direct ownership or through [[img:icon_vassal]][[/img]]vassals and [[img:icon_military_alliance]][[/img]]military allies:

Stitched Up!
Throt's mutant armies are brewing... The Flesh Lab stitches and fixes ever faster!
More Food, Stronger Beast!
The Skavenslaves of Hell Pit are shoveling ever greater amounts of food - anything they can find that's even slightly edible - down the beast's throats, and the world will tremble at the size of the gluttonous monsters!
The Frozen Dead
The finest Norse flesh has made its way to the lab. Now Throt's mutant creations are increasingly powerful, and equally dangerous!


Throt is busy deep down in Hell Pit, mutating any beast or Skaven that gets too close to the Flesh Lab!\\n\\nUnlock all Infantry Augments and Monster Augments.
All manner of Throt's modified creations have been loosed upon the world, thundering towards Kislev and the South on feet most foul. The Vermintide can't be stopped now, no-never!
Norscan bodies are perfect for experiments... They're warped, tainted-foul, and with beautiful flesh! What marvelous experiments it could power. Destroy the Norse dwarfs and corrupted man-things, occupy their frozen lands and use their corpses to grow the most powerful mutagens:

THROT
1
Utterly consumed with his disturbing research, Throt has long since lost whatever hint of sanity he once had. His waking hours are filled with his twisted studies, and the depths of his domain echo with the cacophony of tortured cries from the living abominations dwelling there, the horrid results of his unnatural experiments.

Stitched Up!
Cross-breeding all manner of creatures and utilising the mutating effects of warpstone, Throt is ever seeking to create more destructive creatures to set on his enemies and trade with other clans.

2
From Hell Pit they come, a scurrying tide of ratmen and mutant creations thundering towards the lands of men on feet most foul. Throt's vermintide can't be stopped now!

reward
A Cornucopia of Flesh
Winding lines of corpse-wagons journey towards Hell Pit, ensuring Throt's gluttonous creations have a constant supply of flesh to sate their ravenous appetites.
