# Beastmen

## Taurox - Slaughterhorn Tribe

* **Route I - Banebeast of Naggaroth**
  * The skies over Naggaroth are stained crimson, for the Blood God's gaze has fallen upon the heavily fortified cities of the Dark Elves. Driven by countless turbid visions placed in his mind by Khorne, the Bloodbeast will not stop until all of Naggaroth is his blood-ground.
  * Raze or Conquer the following settlements:
    * Clar Karond, Naggarond, Hag Graef, Ghrond, Har Ganeth, Karond Kar
  * Win 50 battles.
  * **Reward**:
    * _Favoured One_: Khorne corruption +8 (factionwide), Khorne corruption adjacent provinces +5 (factionwide), Allegiance points gained: 50% for alliances and vassalage with Khorne, Diplomatic relations: +20 with Khornate factions
_Reward flavour text:_ Taurox has risen to the pinnacle of Khorne's favour. Even the foremost of the Blood God's daemons are forced to serve in his warherds.

* **Route II - Beastpaths of Ruin**
  * The Slaughterhorn leads his tribe south through the forests of Naggaroth and into the jungles of Lustria, driven ever onwards by portentious visions whispered in his primitive mind by the Ruinous Powers.
  * Raze or Conquer the following settlements:
    * The Witchwood, Quintex, Hexoatl
  * Destroy factions:
    * The Huntsmarshal's Expedition, Ghost of Phauax
  * **Reward**:
    * _Baneblood_: Weapon strength: +20% for Minotaur units, Charge bonus: +10 for Minotaur units, Ward Save +10% for Taurox
_Reward flavour text:_ From Naggaroth to Lustria, all are prey, hunted for sport by the Slaughterhorn tribe. The strands of fate have been cut to shreds by Taurox's rune-tortured axes, and those who were once destined to bring him low now lay dead beneath his bloodsoaked hooves.

* **Route III - The Heart of the Dark**
  * The exact location of this place is never spoken of, but the Bray-Shamans claim that all beastpaths ultimately lead toward it. At its centre is the mightiest herdstone in the whole of the world, resonating with a malignant power that Taurox swears will be his to harness.
  * At the start of your turn, have at least 500 Marks of Ruination
  * Win the following battle: The Fall of Man
  * **Reward**:
    * _Rites of Ruin_: Unit capacity: +5 Ghorgon, Unit capacity: +5 Jabberslythe, Unit capacity: +3 Minotaurs, Minotaurs (Shields), Minotaurs (Great Weapons)
_Reward flavour text:_ The Slaughterhorn tribe enact hideous rites at the Heart of the Dark, feeding thousands of captives into a gaping, gnashing maw at the very foundation of the herdstone. Men suffer evil dreams. Priests are plagued with temptation. Every beast feels a primal urge to kill and destroy, and the Cloven Ones march to war.
