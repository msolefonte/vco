# Beastmen

## Taurox - Slaughterhorn Tribe

* **Route I - Banebeast of Naggaroth**
  * The skies over Naggaroth are stained crimson, for the Blood God's gaze has fallen upon the heavily fortified cities 
  of the Dark Elves. Driven by countless turbid visions placed in his mind by Khorne, the Bloodbeast will not stop until 
  all of Naggaroth is his blood-ground.
  * Raze or Conquer the following settlements:
    * Clar Karond, Naggarond, Hag Graef, Ghrond, Har Ganeth, Karond Kar
  * Occupy, loot, raze or sack 32 settlements.
  * **Reward**:
    * _Favoured One_: Khorne corruption +12 (factionwide), Khorne corruption adjacent provinces +8 (factionwide), 
    Allegiance points gained: 50% for alliances and vassalage with Khorne, Diplomatic relations: +20 with Khornate 
    factions

* **Route II - Beastpaths of Ruin**
  * The Slaughterhorn leads his tribe south through the forests of Naggaroth and into the jungles of Lustria, driven 
  ever onwards by portentious visions whispered in his primitive mind by the Ruinous Powers.
  * Raze or Conquer the following settlements:
    * The Witchwood, Quintex, Hexoatl
  * Destroy factions:
    * The Thousand Maws, The Huntsmarshal's Expedition, Ghost of Phauax

    Fuelled by Rage (faction leader)

* **Route III - The Heart of the Dark**
  * The exact location of this place is never spoken of, but the Bray-Shamans claim that all beastpaths ultimately lead 
  toward it. At its centre is the mightiest herdstone in the whole of the world, resonating with a malignant power that 
  Taurox swears will be his to harness.
