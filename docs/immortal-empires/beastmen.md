**Ideas**

  * Objectives
    * There are champions in the cold North who claim the strength of their arm is unmatched.
      Show them what true strength is. Tear off their arms.
      * Destroy factions: Malekith, Valkia

    * The Chaos Gods will see his foes smote upon ruined lands, and they will see in him greater ruination
      yet. His fury is endless, but the world is not.
      * Accumulate N Marks of Ruination
    * The world will know of Taurox the Brass Bull. His name will inspire dread in all those who hear it.
      Civilisations will underestimate the Bull and they will fall under his hooves.
      * Accumulate N Dread

  * Rewards
    * Great Beasts - Taurox and his beasts grew mighty indeed, tearing across vast lands and 
      razing all in their way. The weaker beasts quickly failed out of the horde, forgotten or dead. 
      Only the strongest beasts can thrive in such a ferocious environment.
      * Bonuses for Minotaurs
    * Greater Monsters - Even beasts of fury and strength can't hope to be favoured over
      great and foul monstrosities.
      * Bonuses for Razorgore/Manticore/Jabberslythe, Giant/Ghorgon/Cygor
