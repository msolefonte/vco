## Taurox: Slaughterhorn Tribe

* **Route I - Banebeast of Naggaroth**
  * The skies over Naggaroth are stained crimson, for the Blood God's gaze has fallen upon the heavily fortified cities of the Dark Elves. Driven by countless turbid visions placed in his mind by Khorne, the Bloodbeast will not stop until all of Naggaroth is his blood-ground.
  * Raze or Conquer the following settlements:
    * Clar Karond, Naggarond, Hag Graef, Ghrond, Har Ganeth, Karond Kar

    * 
* **Route II - Beastpaths of Ruin**
  * The Slaughterhorn leads his tribe south through the forests of Naggaroth and into the jungles of Lustria, driven ever onwards by portentious visions whispered in his primitive mind by the Ruinous Powers.

* **Route III - The Heart of the Dark**
