## Lord Mazdamundi: Hexoatl

* **Route I - The First Decree**
  * "Woe to the warm-bloods who trespass against us. Feed them to the beasts of the jungle and leave their bones to 
  bleach upon the golden shores of our land. Let them see that it is folly to intrude upon the Isthmus." 
  * Control provinces: 
    * Isthmus of Lustria, The Isthmus Coast, Jungles of Pahualaxa

  * **Reward:** 
    * _The Age of Awakening_: Control: +2, Growth: +30, Construction cost: -15% for all buildings, 
    Construction time: -25% for all buildings

* **Route II - Begone Thot!**
