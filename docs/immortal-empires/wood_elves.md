## Sisters of Twilight: Heralds of Ariel

* **Route I - The Dreaming Wood**
  * In the forests of Naggaroth, a portal to the Dreaming Wood grows thin; where beyond, Daemon's rage. Only Ariel can seal the dire portal, but to do so she must draw strength from the Worldroots. Should she fail, the Worldroots will carry the Daemons to the very heart of Athel Loren!
  * Perform 3 rituals of the following category: Worldroots Healing
  * The Hag Queen's machinations have brought Athel Loren to the brink of ruin over the centuries. Even now, she means to use the portal to the Dreaming Wood to usher in the daemonic armies of her Dark Prince. Her scheming must end. 
  * Destroy factions:
    * Cult of Pleasure
  * Occupy or raze settlement:
    * Ghrond
  * **Reward**:
    * _Portal Sealed_: Corruption: -4, Corruption in adjacent provinces: -6
_Reward flavour text:_ The gateway to the Dreaming Wood has been closed, the threat of Daemonic invasion averted - for now. Ariel's heralds must remain vigilant...
    * _Vengeance of the Mage Queen_: Ability number of uses: +1 for "Volley of Kurnous" (all armies), Ability number of uses: +1 for all Dragon breath attacks, Research rate: +50%
_Reward flavour text:_ The Mage Queen stayed her hand in ages past. Her Heralds did not make the same mistake. Morathi is dead. Her Dark Covent unmade. Her Tower of Prophecy torn down to its foundations. Let the world be free of her scheming at last.

* **Route II - Vaul's Anvils**
  * Some whisper that Lord Daith is older even than Ariel and Orion, that he fled Ulthuan with the first colonists; others claim that he is Vaul himself, the Elven God of Smiths who crafted the Widowmaker with the heat of Draugnir's flames. Despite Naestra's protestations, Arahan once brazenly asked the blind smith if this was true. He merely chuckled before returning to the fires of his forge.
  * Occupy settlements:
    * Vaul's Anvil (Naggaroth), Vaul's Anvil (Ulthuan), Vaul's Anvil (Athel Loren)
  * **Reward**:
    * _Godlike Craftsmanship_: Daith's Favour: +33% chance to earn additional Daith's Favour after battles, Naestra's Grace +6 turns (up from 3), Physical resistance +10% (up from 5%); Arahan's Wrath: +6 turns (up from 3), Leadership +8 (up from 4), Missile strength: +10% (up from 5%)
_Reward flavour text:_ With the Hammer of Vaul and Caledor's volcanic furnaces at his disposal, Lord Daith's creations now rival those of the God of Smiths himself.

* **Route III - The Sacred Pools**
  * A single, enormous Zoat emerges from the Worldroots and kneels before the Mage Queen. He claims his herd in Lustria is under threat and petitions the Heralds for aid. To the north of the Sacred Pools, men hack and burn the jungles. Riled, Ariel sends her Heralds to deal with the impudent mayflies.
  * Occupy settlement:
    * The Sacred Pools
  * Destroy factions:
    * The Huntsmarshal's Expedition, Bordeleaux Errant
  * The Chief Priestess of Isha calls for aid, as the forests of Avelorn are under dire threat from the Forces of Chaos. The Mage Queen has decreed that Alarielle has served her purpose. It is time for the Asrai to return to these forests, and for Alarielle to take her eternal seat upon the Oak Throne.
  * Occupy settlements:
    * Gaean Vale
  * Destroy factions:
    * Avelorn
  * Own unit: Ariel
  * **Reward**:
    * _Guardians of the Pools_: Gain +1 additional Forest Health for winning battles in Magical Forests or their Heathlands, Melee attack: +5 when fighting against Men (factionwide)
_Reward flavour text:_ Whether venturing through the Old World or the New, all men should know to fear the forests.
    * _Isha's Embrace_: Cooldown: -30% to Lore of Life spells (Ariel), Ariel leaves lingering bonuses on regions she visits (Control +3, Growth: +10, Chance of Winds of Magic increasing in strength when changing: +10%, Corruption -5, turn duration: 10)
_Reward flavour text:_ Within the Everqueen's Grove, Alarielle sits upon the Oak Throne. Here she will remain forevermore, her magics nourishing the Mage Queen from afar. This is Isha's will.
