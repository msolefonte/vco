## Sisters of Twilight: Heralds of Ariel

* **Route I - The Dreaming Wood**
  * In the forests of Naggaroth, a portal to the Dreaming Wood grows thin; where beyond, Daemon's rage. Only Ariel can seal the dire portal, but to do so she must draw strength from the Worldroots. Should she fail, the Worldroots will carry the Daemons to the very heart of Athel Loren!
  * Perform 3 rituals of the following category: Worldroots Healing
  * Own unit: Ariel
  * The Hag Queen's machinations have brought Athel Loren to the brink of ruin over the centuries. Even now, she means to use the portal to the Dreaming Wood to usher in the daemonic armies of her Dark Prince. Her scheming must end. 
  * Destroy factions:
    * Cult of Pleasure
  * Occupy or raze settlement:
    * Ghrond
  * **Reward**:
    * _Sweet Dreams_: Corruption: -4, Corruption in adjacent provinces: -6
    * _Vengeance of the Mage Queen_: Ability number of uses: +1 for "Volley of Kurnous" (all armies), Ability number of uses: +1 for all Dragon breath attacks, Research rate: +50%

* **Route II - Vaul's Anvils**
  * Some whisper that Lord Daith is older even than Ariel and Orion, that he fled Ulthuan with the first colonists; others claim that he is Vaul himself, the Elven God of Smiths who crafted the Widowmaker with the heat of Draugnir's flames. Despite Naestra's protestations, Arahan once brazenly asked the blind smith if this was true. He merely chuckled before returning to the fires of his forge.
  * Occupy settlements:
    * Vaul's Anvil (Naggaroth), Vaul's Anvil (Ulthuan), Vaul's Anvil (Athel Loren)
  * **Reward**:

* **Route III - The Sacred Pools**
  * A single, enormous Zoat emerges from the Worldroots and kneels before the Mage Queen. He claims his herd in Lustria is under threat and petitions the Heralds for aid. To the north of the Sacred Pools, men hack and burn the jungles. Riled, Ariel sends her Heralds to deal with the impudent mayflies.
  * Occupy settlement:
    * The Sacred Pools
  * Destroy factions:
    * The Huntsmarshal's Expedition, Bordeleaux Errant
  * The Chief Priestess of Isha calls for aid, as the forests of Avelorn are under dire threat from the Forces of Chaos. The Mage Queen has decreed that Alarielle has served her purpose. It is time for the Asrai to return to these forests, and for Alarielle to take her eternal seat upon the Oak Throne.
  * Occupy settlements:
