## N'Kari: Seducers of Slaanesh

* **Route I - The Great Game**
  * Though Slaanesh is presently the least of the four great Ruinous Powers, his brothers secretly fear him, for he feeds on humanity's darkest urges, a source of power that they cannot hope to match. Let the lands of Ulthuan be submerged beneath a writhing, twitching blanket of sin.
  * Achieve the highest corruption in a minimum of 100 regions.
  * Occupy provinces: Caledor, Tiranoc, Nagarythe, Chrace, Cothique, Northern Yvresse, Southern Yvresse, Eataine, Ellyrion, Avelorn, Saphery.
  * **Reward**:
    * _Slaanesh Ascendant_: Leadership +10 when fighting against Elves (factionwide), Weapon strength +10% (N'Kari)
_Reward flavour text:_ The Dark Prince's power waxes so strongly that it can no longer be contained within the Realms of Chaos. Storms howl outwards from the polar gates, driving his servants onwards to commit countless unspeakable acts in his name.

* **Route II - Paradise Lost**
  * "Come, mortal. Gorge yourself on the blood of your beloved, slain by your own hands. Let your lust and despair mingle into a delicious concotion. Then, and only then, will you know the sweet caress of the Dark Prince."
  * Spread 20 Marks of Slaanesh
  * Establish 10 Cults
  * **Reward**:
    * _Cult Following_: Hero action cost: -30%, Hero action success chance: +20%, Hero starting rank: +5
_Reward flavour text:_ Decadance leads to dalliance. Dalliance leads to debauchery. Debauchery leads to death.

* **Route III - The Dark Feast**
  * Let the arrogant fools indulge themselves in fine liquors, exotic sweetmeats and the pleasures of the flesh. Then they shall feast again, and indulge in pleasures of a different sort...
  * Vassalise 6 factions
  * The Arch-Temptor has been thwarted by Aenarion and his hated descendants more times than he would care to admit. The time has come to visit upon them the most exquisite of agonies. Only after they beg for death will their souls be relinquished to the Dark Prince.
  * Destroy factions:
    * Eatine, Order of Loremasters, Naggaroth
  * **Reward**:
    * _Aenarion's Blood_: Allegiance points gained for all factions: +25%, tribute from vassals +100%, Devotees per turn +40,
_Reward flavour text:_ Aenarion's final humiliation is at hand. Vengeance never tasted so sweet...
    * _All The World's A Stage_: Recruit rank: %+3 for Daemonettes of Slaanesh and Exalted Daemonettes of Slaanesh units, Weapon strength: %+5% for Daemonettes of Slaanesh, Exalted Daemonettes of Slaanesh, Chaos Warriors of Slaanesh and Marauders of Slaanesh units
_Reward flavour text:_  And all the men and women merely playthings for the Daemonettes.
