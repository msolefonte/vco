## Skarbrand: Exiles of Khorne

**Ideas**
  * Thoughts
    * Skarbrand has garbage economy and high recruitment costs/upkeep.
      * Changing these in any small way is probably a waste of time?
    * Replenishment is poor, like most monogod factions, despite it being extremely necessary.
    * Skarbrand doesn't particularly care about empire-building
      * Changing his empire-building capability is probably a waste of time?
    * Khorne's initial war is a ruse. Top Knotz are far too spread out, as are most of the desert factions. We should direct the players at Dwarves in route 1. Eight Peaks? Mors?
    * Quest is important and should be incentivised as part of a route.
    * Skarbrand has very little unit variety early game. Can we make it easier to broaden his armies?
    * Several bonuses/techs/skills relate to hating Slaneshi factions. Should we have that form part of a route?
    * Blood Hosts are a large part of Skarbrand's gameplay and they're only really sacking and razing. We should definitely keep a sack/raze route.

**Route I - Blood for the Blood God*
  * There must be more slaughter, more death, and more blood. There must be more armies under Skarbrand's banner.
    * Own 60 units.
  * These blades sow death and destruction upon all, but they are not enough. Slaughter & Carnage await your grasp, and the blood of your foes.
    * Complete Mission: Slaughter & Carnage
  * **Reward:** 
    * The Reaping: Skarbrand's forces sweep across the land at pace, staining the lands with blood.
      * Passive "Hellblade" for all Bloodletters and Bloodthirsters
    * The Recovery: The servants of Khorne shrug off their wounds, for Khorne does not care from whom the blood spills.
      * +4% replenishment (all armies)

**Route II - Skulls for the Skull Throne*
  * Earn 8888 skulls (script_key: `vco_kho_exiles_of_khorne_skulls_earned`)
  * Thousands of Skaven slaves. Regiments of Imperial conscripts. Cults of filthy Slaaneshi devotees. Send their skulls to Khorne.
    * Destroy 1 faction: Clan Mors, Clan Rictus, Clan Skryre
    * Destroy 1 faction: Reikland, The Golden Order, Cult of Sigmar
    * Destroy 1 faction: The Ecstatic Legion, Seekers of Slaanesh
  * **Reward:** 
    * The Throne Grows: X 

**Route III - Unending Rage*
  * Reach Level 40 with Skarbrand (script_key: `vco_kho_exiles_of_khorne_skarbrand_rank`)
  * Raze N settlements
  * Spread Khorne corruption in X regions
  * **Reward:** 
    * A Devasted World for Khorne: X
    * A Devasting Reward for Skarbrand: X
