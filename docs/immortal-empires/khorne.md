## Skarbrand: Exiles of Khorne

**Ideas**

  * Thoughts
    * Skarbrand has garbage economy and high recruitment costs/upkeep.
      * Changing these in any small way is probably a waste of time?
    * Replenishment is poor, like most monogod factions, despite it being extremely necessary.
    * Skarbrand doesn't particularly care about empire-building
      * Changing his empire-building capability is probably a waste of time?
    * Khorne's initial war is a ruse. Top Knotz are far too spread out, as are most of the desert factions. We should direct the players at Dwarves in route 1. Eight Peaks? Mors?
    * Quest is important and should be incentivised as part of a route.
    * Skarbrand has very little unit variety early game. Can we make it easier to broaden his armies?

  * Objectives
    * The verminous rats breed tens of thousands of slaves to fill their mines and dig their tunnels. Find them, send their skulls to Khorne.
      * Destroy faction: Clan Mors 
    * The ratmen's skulls pile high, but there is something missing. Slaughter and Carnage call to you, their need for blood has grown.
      * Complete quest.
