## Skarbrand: Exiles of Khorne

**Ideas**
  * Thoughts
    * Skarbrand has garbage economy and high recruitment costs/upkeep.
      * Changing these in any small way is probably a waste of time?
    * Replenishment is poor, like most monogod factions, despite it being extremely necessary.
    * Skarbrand doesn't particularly care about empire-building
      * Changing his empire-building capability is probably a waste of time?
    * Khorne's initial war is a ruse. Top Knotz are far too spread out, as are most of the desert factions. We should direct the players at Dwarves in route 1. Eight Peaks? Mors?
    * Quest is important and should be incentivised as part of a route.
    * Skarbrand has very little unit variety early game. Can we make it easier to broaden his armies?
    * Several bonuses/techs/skills relate to hating Slaneshi factions. Should we have that form part of a route?
    * Blood Hosts are a large part of Skarbrand's gameplay and they're only really sacking and razing. We should definitely keep a sack/raze route.

**Route I - Blood for the Blood God*
  * There must be more slaughter, more death, and more blood. There must be more armies under Skarbrand's banner.
    * Own 60 units.
  * These blades you hold sow death and destruction upon all, but they are not enough. Slaughter & Carnage await your grasp and the blood of your foes.
    * Complete Mission: Slaughter & Carnage
  * **Reward:** 
    * The Reaping: Skarbrand's forces sweep across the land at pace, staining the lands with blood.
      * Passive "Hellblade" for all Bloodletters and Bloodthirsters
    * The Recovery: Khorne's servants shrug off their wounds, for he does not care from whom the blood spills.
      * +4% replenishment (all armies)

**Route II - Skulls for the Skull Throne*
  * Earn 8888 skulls (script_key: `vco_kho_exiles_of_khorne_skulls_earned`)
  * Thousands of Skaven slaves. Legions of Imperial conscripts. Cults of filthy Slaaneshi devotees. Send their skulls to Khorne.
    * Destroy 1 faction: Clan Mors, Clan Rictus, Clan Skryre
    * Destroy 1 faction: Reikland, The Golden Order, Cult of Sigmar
    * Destroy 1 faction: The Ecstatic Legion, Seekers of Slaanesh
  * **Reward:** 
    * The Throne Grows: 
      * Skulls earned from battle +15% (effect_key: `wh3_main_effect_kho_post_battle_skull_income`)
      * X

**Route III - Unending Rage*
  * Reach Level 40 with Skarbrand (script_key: `vco_kho_exiles_of_khorne_skarbrand_rank`)
  * Raze 40 settlements
  * Spread Khorne corruption in 40 regions
  * **Reward:** 
    * Devasted World: The world is in flames, broken and crumbling. Khorne may look upon his exiled Bloodthirster with pride.
      * X
    * Devastating Reward: Skarbrand may once again walk among the Hunting Fields and the Cracked Lands of the Blood God's Domain. Demons flock to his armies in fervorous admiration.
      * 25% recruitment cost reduction for Bloodletters, Flesh Hounds of Khorne, Chaos Furies (Khorne), Exalted Bloodletters, Bloodcrushers, Bloodthirsters
      * 10% upkeep reduction for Bloodletters, Flesh Hounds of Khorne, Chaos Furies (Khorne), Exalted Bloodletters, Bloodcrushers, Bloodthirsters
