## Skarbrand: Exiles of Khorne

**Ideas**

  * Thoughts
    * Skarbrand has garbage economy and high recruitment costs/upkeep.
      * Changing these in any small way is probably a waste of time?
    * Replenishment is poor, like most monogod factions, despite it being extremely necessary.
    * Skarbrand doesn't particularly care about empire-building
      * Changing his empire-building capability is probably a waste of time?
    * Khorne's initial war is a ruse. Top Knotz are far too spread out, as are most of the desert factions. We should direct the players at Dwarves in route 1. Eight Peaks?
