## Tyrion: Eataine

* **Route I - Defender of Ulthuan**
  * Prince Tyrion is the Defender of Ulthuan and the protector of its people, a heavy burden entrusted to him by the 
  Phoenix King Finubar. Among the Dark Elves of Naggaroth he is known as the Reaper, to the Goblins of Red-Axe Pass he 
  is Orcbane, and to the north the Norse know him as Mankiller. For two centuries he has stood between the Elves of 
  Ulthuan and their many foes as an unbreakable shield against the darkness.

  elf for far too long. This civil war must end.
  * Destroy factions: 
    * Naggarond
  * Tyrion concerns himself only with the twin duties of protecting Ulthuan and its Everqueen, the beloved Alarielle.

  Alarielle's consort, and has been for many years.

* **Route III - The Fate of the Soul**
  * The fate of Tyrion's soul teeters on a blade-edge. Will he succumb to Aenarion's curse and salve his people's

  together against the forces of Chaos?
