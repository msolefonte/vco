# High Elves

## Tyrion - Eataine

* **Route I - Defender of Ulthuan**
  * Prince Tyrion is the Defender of Ulthuan and the protector of its people, a heavy burden entrusted to him by the Phoenix King Finubar. Among the Dark Elves of Naggaroth he is known as the Reaper, to the Goblins of Red-Axe Pass he is Orcbane, and to the north the Norse know him as Mankiller. For two centuries he has stood between the Elves of Ulthuan and their many foes as an unbreakable shield against the darkness.
  * Destroy factions:
    * Seducers of Slaanesh, The Dreadfleet, Broken Axe, The Drowned
  * Occupy provinces: Caledor, Tiranoc, Nagarythe, Chrace, Cothique, Northern Yvresse, Southern Yvresse, Eataine, Ellyrion, Avelorn, Saphery
  * **Reward**:
    * _The Age of Sanctuary_: Control: +4, Growth: 60, Income from Ports: +50%
_Reward flavour text:_ Not since the Age of Colonisation have the Elves known such prosperity.

* **Route II - All's Fair in Love and War**
  * Malekith's ruinous ambitions have brought death and destruction to Ulthuan for centuries. Elf has fought against elf for far too long. This civil war must end.
  * Destroy factions: 
    * Naggarond
  * Tyrion concerns himself only with the twin duties of protecting Ulthuan and its Everqueen, the beloved Alarielle. However, the latter is seen less as a duty than it is a calling of the heart - it is common knowledge that Tyrion is Alarielle's consort, and has been for many years.
  * Occupy settlement:
    * Lothern, Gaean Vale
  * Build Landmark:
    * Court of the Phoenix King
  * **Reward**: 
    * _Dawn of a New Age_: All remaining Dark Elf factions suffer -10 control, +10 Leadership when fighting against Dark Elves (factionwide), Recruit rank: +2 for all units
_Reward flavour text:_ With the Witch King's demise, revolts have broken out across Naggaroth. Thousands of slaves and druchii defectors flee the Black Cities, and some even flock to your banner.

    * _The Everchild_: Influence per turn: +10, Corruption -2
_Reward flavour text:_ Ostensibly the progeny of the Everqueen and the Phoenix King, some whisper that Aliathra's pedigree is... less than certain.

* **Route III - The Fate of the Soul**
  * The fate of Tyrion's soul teeters on a blade-edge. Will he succumb to Aenarion's curse and salve his people's wounded pride with the blood of old enemies, or will he put aside those grievances and reforge old alliances to stand together against the forces of Chaos?

    * Shrine of Khaine, The Oak of Ages, Karaz-a-Karak

  * **Reward**:
    * _Reunification_: All Wood Elf factions (excluding Wargrove of Woe and Spirits of Shanlin) become vassals, diplomatic relations with Wood Elves +60
_Reward flavour text:_ After centuries of isolation, the Asrai now answer to Phoenix King and the Elves of Ulthuan.
