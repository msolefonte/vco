# Ogre Kingdoms

## Greasus Goldtooth - Goldtooth Tribe

* **Route I - Too Rich to Walk**
  * The Goldtooth tribe is notorious for its wealth. Ever eager to show off their top status, they are given to 
  ostentatious displays - from a vast mountaintop feast hall, to gem-encrusted gutplates and even a solid gold Mawtooth. 
  Now, under the rule of Greasus, the tribe will grow richer still.
  * Have a gross income of 25,000
  * Construct 2 buildings:
    * Mint (Gold Resource)
  * Construct 1 building:
    * Big Gem Mine (Diamond Resource)
  * **Reward**: 
    * _Hoardmaster_: +30 Diplomacy all factions, Global recruitment capacity +2

* **Route II - Overtyrant's Reign**
  * Greasus' overflowing coffers have not diminished his greed nor his all-consuming desire to conquer everything he 
  sees. The Tribestealer will unite the Ogres of the Mountains of Mourn into the largest Ogre Kingdom in history!
  * Occupy provinces: 
    * Path to the East, Gash Kadrak, Ancient Giant Lands, Bone Road, Mountains of Mourn, Ivory Road, Wyrm Pass, 
    Gnoblar Country
  * The Black Orc known as Grimgor Ironhide seeks to challenge Greasus' reign, brazenly dubbing himself "Boss of the 
  East". The Sceptre of Titans will disabuse him of this notion.

    * Grimgor's 'Ardboyz

* **Route III - Drakecrush**
  * Maintaining strong ties with the Cathayans will ensure their wealth continues to flow into the Hoardmaster's 
  coffers. Alternatively, Greasus could move against their draconic masters directly, after all, they don't call him 
  Drakecrush for nothing.
  * Control regions either directly or diplomatically:
    * Shang-Yang, Hanyu Port, Kunlan, Wei-Jin, Nan-Gau
  * Occupy settlement:
    * Great Hall of Greasus
