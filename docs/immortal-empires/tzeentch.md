## Kairos Fateweaver: Oracles of Tzeentch

* **Route I - The Great Game**
  * Tzeentch's ultimate goal is utterly unknowable. Perhaps the Great Game and even the destruction of the Old World are
  merely amusing diversions for the Great Schemer. The realisation of his greater plan, if he has one, is lost in the
  mists of the far future.
  * Achieve the highest corruption in a minimum of 100 regions.
  * Obtain at least 2000 Grimoires
  * **Reward**:
    * _Tzeentch Ascendant_: Tzeentch corruption in adjacent regions: +15, Hero & Lord recruit rank +5, Winds of Magic
    cost: -15% for Lore of Tzeentch spells

* **Route II - Visions of the Past**
  * The Fateweaver gazes back into the past, witnessing his past self breach the magical barriers of the Lizardmen's
  temple-cities. He saw with only one pair of eyes back then, and thus was blind to his imminent defeat. This time,
  history will not repeat itself...
  * Destroy factions:
    * Ghosts of Pahuax, Cult of Sotek, Itza
  * Raze settlement:
    * Itza
  * **Reward**:
    * _Artifacts of the Old Ones_: Ability: "Supreme Shield of the Old Ones", Chance of Winds of Magic increasing in
    strength when changing: +10%, Barrier: +20% during battles (factionwide)

* **Route III - Visions of the Future**
  * The Fateweaver casts his mind forward and beholds a grim future. The Elves, Dwarfs and Lizardmen march together as
  one in an unstoppable alliance, united by the machinations of an Elven wizard within the halls of a golden dwarfhold.
  But to Kairos, fate is as malleable as clay. He will ensure such an eventuality does not come to pass.
  * Destroy factions:
    * Order of Loremasters, Last Defenders
  * Occupy or raze settlement
    * Karak Zorn
  * **Reward**:
    * _Trinkets of the Slain_: Ability: "Potion of Charoi", Bound spell: "Hand of Gods", Magic item drop chance: +50%
