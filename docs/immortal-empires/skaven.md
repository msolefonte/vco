## Throt the Unclean - Clan Moulder

* **Route I - Yes-yes, prepare for war!**
  * **Throt is busy deep down in Hell Pit, ever strengthening his mutant armies. Soon enough his hordes will surge forth from the pit, and they shall be fearsome.**
  * Unlock all Infantry Augments and Monster Augments
  * Build landmark: Depths of the Pit
    * **War Footing**: Research rate +50%, Growth Juice per turn +40
    * **Throt's mutant armies are ready and the Vermintide awaits. Hell Pit has geared up for war!**

* **Route II - The Vermintide Comes**
  * **All manner of Throt's modified creations have been loosed upon the world, thundering towards Kislev and the South on feet most foul. The Vermintide can't be stopped now, no-never!**
  * Destroy factions: 
    * The Ice Court, The Great Orthodoxy
  * Occupy/Raze at least 4 settlements:
    * Kislev, Altdorf, Middenheim, Brass Keep, Gryphon Wood, Castle Drakenhof, Karak Kadrin
    * **More food, stronger beast!**: Food generated: X per turn, recruit rank +X for mutants
**The skavenslaves of Hell Pit are shoveling ever greater amounts of food - anything they can find that's even slightly edible - down the beast's throats, and the world will tremble at the size of the gluttonous monsters!**

* **Route III - Harvest Chaos Specimens (tbd)**
  * Oh yes-yes, warped flesh, tainted-foul and beautiful it is! I need it, what experiments I could do... Greater than ever before, Throt would be!
  * Destroy/ally factions: The Ecstatic Legions, Wintertooth, Hag Graef, Ursun Revivalists, Legion of Chaos, Warhost of the Apocalypse
    * **Tainted-Foul Flesh**: Mutagens per turn X, weapon strength +10% for mutants or casualty replenishment 10% for mutants
**The finest chaos-tainted flesh specimens have made their way to Throt's Flesh Lab and his mutant creations are increasingly chaos-infused, and increasingly dangerous!**
