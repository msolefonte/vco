# Daemons of Chaos

## Daemon Prince - Legion of Chaos

* **Route I - Ascension**
  * "Gods of Chaos... I have tasted but a morsel of your power... Look at what I have achieved! Let me feast upon it! Kislev will be mine, and together, we will serve you. Bestow me with your terrible grace!"
  * Ascend in service to any Chaos God, or as an Undivided champion of all.
  * Occupy, loot, raze or sack 35 different settlements.
  * **Reward**:
    * _Worldslayer_: Campaign movement range: +20% after winning a battle (all characters), Upkeep -10% for Daemon units
_Reward flavour text:_ First Kislev, then the world. All will bow before my dark majesty!

* **Route II - Succeeding You**
  * There are those who seek to challenge your ascension. Seek them out, and bring about their ruin.
  * Win 35 battles.
  * The so-called "Everchosen" presumptuously commands you to serve in his armies. The Godslayer answers to no one! Archaon must be taught a lesson in humility.
  * Destroy or vassalise factions:
    * Warhost of the Apocalypse
  * The Red Tzar, Boris Ursus, stands against you. His faith in the false god Ursun is not a strength, but a weakness. One that you will easily exploit.
  * Destroy or vassalise factions:
    * Ursun Revivalists
  * Be'lakor... the betrayer. Through unknown means he has achieved physical form once more and now doubtless plots against you on the Isle of Albion. Banish him back to the shadows.
  * Destroy or vassalise factions:
    * Shadow Legion
  * **Reward**:
    * _Everchosen_: +20 diplomatic relations for Daemons of Chaos, Warriors of Chaos, Beastmen and Norsca.
_Reward flavour text:_ Rage and humiliation burning in his soul, Be'lakor places the Crown of Domination upon your brow and kneels before you, the true Everchosen.

* **Route III - Frozen Heart**
  * "Ursun has forsaken you. He has forsaken Kislev! Give yourselves fully to the Dark Brothers. Only through their strength will we find salvation!"
  * Destroy factions:
    * Ice Court, Grand Orthodoxy
  * Conquer or raze the following settlements:
    * Erengrad, Praag, Kislev
  * **Reward**:
    * _God of Kislev_: +20% Weapon Strength, +20% Ward Save for the Godslayer
_Reward flavour text:_ Ursun is dead. The Daemon Prince finally has what Be'lakor's lying tongue once promised: the fathomless power of a God.

    * _Daemon Queen_: Motherland ice effect on all your provinces 24/7. (Causes attrition to enemy armies within your territory, -10 Leadership for enemy armies within your territory.) (Would be cool if we could generate the blizzard effect on campaign map, same as Kislev, but I will have to run feasibility tests to see if this is even possible).
_Reward flavour text:_ My dearest Katarin, how I have longed for this day...
