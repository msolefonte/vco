## Grombrindal - The Ancestral Throng
* **Route I - Snorri Whitebeard's Final Grudge**
  * Gotrek Starbreak had declared the grudge against the Elves settled when he took the Phoenix Crown from their king's broken corpse, but Grombrindal knew that was not the end of the matter. He knew the one truly responsible had not yet paid for his wrongdoings. The one who once swore eternal friendship between elf and dwarf. The one who now called himself 'Witch King': Malekith.
  * Destroy factions:
    * Naggarond
OVERWRITE TEXT: Occupy the Black Cities of the Dark Elves:
TEXT OVERWRITE: Control the following [[url:#]]Black Cities[[/url]] either by [[img:sword_of_khaine]][[/img]]conquest or through [[img:icon_vassal]][[/img]]vassals and [[img:icon_military_alliance]][[/img]]military allies:

    * Clar Karond, Naggarond, Hag Graef, Ghrond, Har Ganeth, Karond Kar
  * **Reward**:
    * _REWARD TITLE_: Grungi's Condemnation: A dilemma will offer a choice between powerful rewards!
_Reward flavour text:_ The Witch King is dead, turned to stone by Grungi's judgment. His hateful empire is in ruins, and his great betrayal has finally been avenged.

DILEMMA:
FLAVOUR TEXT: The dead have been avenged, but there are still foes out in the world. The Karaz Ankor still have need of the White Dwarf. The time has come for Grombindal to decide the fate of the Elgi race. Should the War of Vengeance begin again, or should peace reign?

BUTTON 1 TITLE: Forgive the Elves
BUTTON 1 FLAVOUR: The Grudge is struck. The Witch King's veiled machinations have been laid bare for all to see. Let us reforge the old alliances and stand together as one against the coming darkness.

BUTTON 2 TITLE: Condemn the Elves
BUTTON 2 FLAVOUR: Malekith has proved that the Elgi cannot be trusted. It is in their nature to lie and decieve, and the Dawi would be fools to forget this. The War of Vengeance will begin anew, and this time it will not end until we have their unconditional surrender. Muster the throngs - we march to Ulthuan!
BUTTON 2 REWARDS:
    * -40 Diplomatic relations with High Elves & Wood Elves
    * Oathgold generated: +800 (one-off reward, NOT per turn)

* **Route II - The Choice**
  * Fell forces now gather against elves and dwarfs. Malekith, embittered by his maiming in the Flame of Asuryan, seeks to destroy them both, but still darker powers are also at work. Already strained, disharmony sours relations between them until only enmity remains. Will the White Dwarf stoke the fires of war, or will he douse them instead?

DILEMMA:
FLAVOUR TEXT: 

BUTTON 1 TITLE: Valaya's Protection
BUTTON 1 FLAVOUR: Some say the White Dwarf holds a special place in Valaya's heart, though such utterances are blasmpheous, for she is the wife of Grungni. Nevertheless, she seems eager to give Grombrindal and his Ancestral Throng her blessing.
