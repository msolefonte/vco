## Grombrindal: The Ancestral Throng

* **Route I - Snorri Whitebeard's Final Grudge**
  * Gotrek Starbreak had declared the grudge against the Elves settled when he took the Phoenix Crown from their king's 
  broken corpse, but Grombrindal knew that was not the end of the matter. He knew the one truly responsible had not yet 
  paid for his wrongdoings. The one who once swore eternal friendship between elf and dwarf. The one who now called 
  himself 'Witch King': Malekith.
  * Destroy factions:
    * Naggarond
  * Occupy the following settlements:
    * Clar Karond, Naggarond, Hag Graef, Ghrond, Har Ganeth, Karond Kar
  * **Reward**:
    * _Grungi's Condemnation_: A dilemma will offer a choice between powerful rewards!
    * _Forgive the Elves_: Allegiance points gained: +100% for High Elves and Wood Elves, Oathgold cost for Runecraft 
    -10%, Diplomatic relations 40 with Dark Elves, High Elves and Wood Elves
    * _Condemn the Elves_: Missile resistance: +20% when fighting against Elves, Oathgold generated: +40 per turn, 
    Diplomatic relations -40 with Dark Elves, High Elves and Wood Elves

* **Route II - The Fate of the Elves**
  * Fell forces now gather against Elves and Dwarfs. Malekith, embittered by his maiming in the Flame of Asuryan, seeks 
  to destroy them both, but still darker powers are also at work. Already strained, disharmony sours relations between 
  them until only enmity remains. Will the White Dwarf stoke the fires of war, or will he douse them instead?
  * Occupy settlements directly or via diplomacy:
    * Lothern, Witchwood
  * Occupy at least 5 of the following settlements:
    * Vaul's Anvil (Caledor), Tor Anroc, Tor Anlec, Tor Achare, Tor Koruali, Tor Yvresse, Elessaeli, Saphery, Tor Elyr, 
    Gaean Vale
  * **Reward**:
    * _The Wealth of the Elves_: Income from trade tariffs: +50%, Oathgold from buildings: +50% (factionwide)

* **Route III - The Age of Reckoning**
  * The White Dwarf has led his Ancestral Throng across the Boiling Sea and onto the shores of Naggaroth. Those who 
  answered his call know they march with the Ancestor Gods themselves as they bring ruin to those who would stand 
  against them in these bleak lands.
  * Ensure that the total severity of grudges is no greater than 9.
  * Destroy factions:
    * Legion of the Gorequeen, The Drowned, Slaughterhorn Tribe
  * **Reward**:
    * _Manifest Destiny_: Turn time -5 between each passing of the Living Ancestor event, Casualty replenishment rate: 
    +10% (factionwide), Construction cost: -10% for all buildings
