## Karl Franz: Reikland

* **Route I - Protector of the Empire**
  * A mysterious plague spreads from the north. Beastmen prey upon the Emperor's loyal subjects within the Drakwald 
  forest. Marienburg's secession drains the imperial coffers on a daily basis. Barely recovered from his most recent 
  skirmish with the Greenskins at Black Fire Pass, Karl Franz readies the men for a new campaign to unite the west 
  provinces of his Empire.
  * Control provinces
    * Reikland, Helmgart, The Wasteland, Fort Bergbres, Middenheim, Laurelorn Forest, The Misty Hills, Nordland,

* **Route II - Defier of the Dark**
  * Grim tidings make their way from the east. Despite his apparent death beneath the ramparts of Altdorf many years 
  ago, the vampire Vlad von Carstein has returned. While he musters his legion of the dead, malicious tree spirits 
  gather in the Gryphon Wood, slaughtering good citizens of the Empire without rhyme or reason. This cannot stand. Karl 
  Franz orders his men east to put down these new threats to his reign once and for all.

* **Route III - Karl the Uniter**
  * The Empire has close ties with the nations of men, elves and dwarfs that share its borders, though relations have 
  been erratic at best over the years. Now is the time for the Emperor to decide whether to strengthen these alliances 
  or to annex their lands for his ever-growing Empire.
  * Occupy at least 3 regions either directly or diplomatically:
    * Couronne, Oak of Ages, Kislev, Karaz-a-Karak, Lothern
