## Ku'gath: Poxmakers of Nurgle

* **Route I - The Great Game**
  * The Plague Lord, obsessed with his ceaseless foetid experiments, seems to care little about the Great Game. Yet his 
  carefree demeanour subtly undermines the plotting and politicking of the other Chaos Gods. It drives Khorne to an 
  unthinking fury, disturbs Tzeentch's insidious train of thought, and distracts Slaanesh from his scheming. Meanwhile, 
  Nurgle's own intrigues spread slowly like a contagious fever.
  * Achieve the highest corruption in a minimum of 100 regions.
  * Obtain at least 2000 Infections
  * **Reward**:
    * _Nurgle Ascendant_: Nurgle corruption in adjacent regions: +15, Chance of a plague spreading: +10%, Hero capacity: 
    +5 for Cultists

* **Route II - Eastern Poxes**
  * Ku'gath journeys east, eager to discover new reagents in the exotic jungles of Cathay. But first, an unexpected foe 
  bars his passage: Helman Ghorst. He who shunned the Urfarther's gift of the Blue Roses. The Plaguefather is most 
  intriguied by this individual and wishes to test his susceptibility to his more recent creations.
  * Destroy factions:
    * Caravan of Blue Roses, The Western Provinces, Spirit of the Jungle
  * Occupy/Raze settlement:
    * Jungles of Chi'an, Haunted Forest
  * **Reward**:
    * _Ghorst Imprisoned_: Infection cost: -20%, Weapon strength: +5% when fighting against Vampire Counts, Vampire 
    Coast and Tomb Kings
    * _Zin-Fa the Ever-Pustulent_: Growth per region: +5 after winning a battle (all provinces), Missile resistance: 
    10% when fighting against Cathay


* **Route III - Death to the Dwarfs!**
  * It is during forays into the Known World that Ku'gath has encountered the one mortal race that has penetrated his 
  scientific detachment to kindle his rage - the Dwarfs. On a professional level, the Plaguefather hates the creatures 
  for their resilience to disease; on a personal level, he is embittered by a truly ignominious defeat beneath the walls 
  of Karaz-a-Karak. Either way, there is no doubt in Ku'gath's mind as to the first test subjects when his perfect 
  plague is prepared.
  * Raze or sack 10 different settlements belonging to the following race: Dwarfs
  * Occupy/Raze settlement:
    * Karaz-a-Karak
  * The Brewmaster means to sample the polluted River Ruin for new reagents for his concotions. To do so, he must travel 
  north and seek out the corruption at its source.
  * Occupy the following regions:
    * Ruin's End, Pigbarter, The Daemon's Stump, Zhar Naggrund
  * **Reward**:
    * _The Urfather's Forgiveness_: Missile strength for Ku'gath, Speed for Ku'gath, Passive ability: "Acid Ichor"
    * _River Ruin Pathogen_: Armour: +10 for Nurglings, Melee defence: +5 for Nurglings
