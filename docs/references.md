# References and Jokes

## Cathay

* **In Harmony:** Simple reference to the core of the faction.
* **Cool and Aloof:** Running joke in the community. Miao Ying has been defined hundreds of times as someone cool and
aloof.
* **Nan-Gau-style Chicken:** Reference to the Chinese cuisine. Kairos is the chicken and Nan-Gau is the capital of the
Northern Provinces.
* **Iron into Gold:** Zhao Ming is the Iron Dragon and is known to be an alchemist. The origin of alchemy was to achieve
transmutation, which basically means turning iron into gold. He is doing here by getting really rich.
* **500048:** This one is hard to get because it is mean to be read as 5000 48. In Chinese, 48 sounds like "wealthy for
X lifetimes", so the objective here is to amass enough money to live 5000 lives. Hope is enough for an Immortal Dragon!

## Daemons of Chaos

* **Succeeding You**: Reference to Warcraft III, where Prince Arthas returns to his homeland after being corrupted and
kills the king, who loves and trusted him for that mission. Very close story to that of Yuri.

## Khorne

* **Blood for the Blood God:** Classical war cry and motto used by the Legions and servants of the Chaos God Khorne.
* **Skulls for the Skull Throne:** The very same thing.
* **Smash!:** Well, Slaanesh.
* **8/88/888/88888:** The number 8 is sacred for Khorne. I like to play with that kind of reference.

## Kislev

* **United and Indivisible:** Part of Russia's motto from 1918 to 1929.
* **From Kislev with Love:** Allusion to to both "From Russia wih Love" and the relationship between the Tzarina and Yuri.
* **The Red Room:** Ice Witches and Frost Maidens remind me to Marvel's Black Widows. This route is both a reference to
them and the KGB.
* **Wololo:** Classical reference to the priest battle cry from Age of Empires.
* **There can only be one:** According to a website without sources, the original Rasputin said this quote.
* **Son of Kislev:** Reference to the Warhammer short story Son of Kislev and to Kostaltyn burning a cult of Slaanesh.
* **Hibernate until Chaos Dwarfs are out:** Here we are, waiting for the obvious DLC. Obvious bear reference.
* **Bear Hug:** Obvious bear reference again, but also a reference to the parent-child relationship between Boris and
the Tzarina.

## Nurgle

* **The Great Game:** Reference to the conflict between the different Chaos Gods for dominance.
* **Inevitable:** Shot out to Thanos in Avengers: Endgame focused around the idea that, even if Kairos can see the
future, he will lose anyway.
* **Black Death:** Allusion to both the bubonic plague pandemic occurring in Afro-Eurasia from 1346 to 1353 and to
the fall of Altdorf during The End Times.

## Ogre Kingdoms

* **Too Rich to Walk:** Kinda obvious.
* **Sweet and Sour Dragon:** Another reference to Chinese cuisine.
* **Overtyrantâ€™s Reign:** Reference to Greasus Goldtooth being considering the king that holds power over all the other
Ogre Tyrants.
* **The Maw-that-Walks:** Allusion to one of the multiple Skrag the Slaughterer nicknames.
* **The Age of the Ogres:** Not really a reference, just cool.

## Slaanesh

* **The Great Game:** Reference to the conflict between the different Chaos Gods for dominance.
* **Toxic Masculinity:** Choke me harder daddy thing.
* **The Greatest Orgy:** Allusion to the classical film recorded by Morathi on her youth.

## Tzeentch

* **The Great Game:** Reference to the conflict between the different Chaos Gods for dominance.
* **Not So Grand:** Running joke on the community, which considered Cathay to be small in area and called it Not So
Grand Cathay.
* **Iron Man:** Reference to Avengers: Endgame. The Nurgle route against Tzeentch is called Inevitable, so you can
picture it yourself.
