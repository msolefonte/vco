ok, here's my suggestions :
for Empire : "Sigmar's Dream Reborn" (since he's the founder and unificator of the Empire)
for Bretonnia : "An Absolute Monarchy" (The land is a kingdom and united into one single authority)
for Kislev : "One Wall Against Chaos" (all forces of the motherland are united in order to deal with chaos)
for Cathay : "The Celestial Empire Gathered" (No more rivalties between siblings, the empire is united)
I didn't have much ideas for kislev especially
do you plan to do it with all factions or only the "order" ones ?
for the kislev one I know that Katarin is wanting an unified kislev, but it would feel too similar to the empire's one if I use this notion I think

If you're really not sure, there's benefits to making references like in Lord defeat traits
e.g. "Council Abolished" for Bretonnia, in reference to Crusader Kings
or, on a similar vein, "Renovatio Imperii" for the Empire, in reference to Europa Universalis IV
my suggestions are all paradox games but you get the idea


Empire: Renovatio Imperii
Bretonnia: Council Abolished
Kislev: United Motherland
Cathay: The Celestial Empire
Dwarfs: Karaz Ankor Rebuit

tomb kings are quite independant, but they are also very much attached to their territory
if you want to add them I think a cool name would be "Nehhekhara Unspoiled"
for Lizardmen it would be "All According to the Great Plan"
High Elves could be something like "The Phenix King reigns alone"
ogre kingdoms maybe something about being the fatest
like "The Fattest of Tyranny"
or "The Biggest Tyrant Between the Mountains of Mourn"
just giving ideas
for rewards I don't know what it can be
big buffs would be pretty conventional
but other things like access to unique elite units picked from the lore could be very interesting
