ancillaries_colour_text_vco_anc_arcane_item_cube_of_darkness	Found in the metal ark beneath Xhotl, the Cube of Darkness is as alien as it is powerful. Viewed up close, this small black cube contains millions of tiny pin-pricks of blinking light, each circling a sphere of pure darkness. By implementing the correct pattern of thoughts, the cube may be opened for a fraction of a second, inexpleciably drawing the very Winds of Magic into its depths.	true
