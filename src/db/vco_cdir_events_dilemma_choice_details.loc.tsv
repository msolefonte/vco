cdir_events_dilemma_choice_details_localised_choice_title_vco_chs_arc_dilemma_slayer_kingsFIRST	You are free, daemon. Free to serve as my pack mule. Now go, search the corpses of the slain. Bring back anything of value you find.	false
cdir_events_dilemma_choice_details_localised_choice_title_vco_chs_arc_dilemma_slayer_kingsSECOND	I said I would set you free, mighty daemon. I never said when.	false

cdir_events_dilemma_choice_details_localised_choice_title_vco_dwf_gro_dilemma_elvesSECOND	Malekith proved that the Elgi cannot be trusted. It is in their nature to lie and decieve, and the Dawi would be fools to forget this. The War of Vengeance will begin anew, and this time it will not end until we have their unconditional surrender. Muster the throngs - we march to Ulthuan!	true
cdir_events_dilemma_choice_details_localised_choice_title_vco_ksl_kat_dilemma_call_for_aidFIRST	The knights of fair Bretonnia are far removed from the grim troubles of the north, but they are ever hungry for glory and would surely jump at this chance to prove their valour. 	true

The squabbling Elector Counts would do well to remember that. It is in their mutual interest to lend us their support.	true
cdir_events_dilemma_choice_details_localised_choice_title_vco_vmp_man_dilemma_ossified_portalFIRST	I must return to Castle Drakenhof and study these books further.
