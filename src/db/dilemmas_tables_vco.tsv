vco_chs_arc_dilemma_slayer_kings	U'zhul's Fate	Release me from this steel thralldom, Everchosen, so that I may kill for mighty Khorne once more. To taste the blood he spills, rather than watch it drip down the walls of my prison. To wield, and not be wielded. You swore I would be free! You swore!	vco_archaon_dilemma	false	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_vmp_man_dilemma_ossified_portal	The Ossified Portal	Mannfred raises the Timor Noctis towards the fell moon shining balefully over the desert. He chants sonorously as the blade glows with power, an unholy dirge that fuses the bones of a dozen conquered Tomb Kings into a great ossified portal that thrums with Dhar magic. The way to Sylvania is open.	vco_mannfred_dilemma	false	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
