vco_brt_alb_dilemma_mananns_favour	The Sea God's Boon	Alberic holds his trident high as the last of the pirates' ships slips beneath the waves.

vco_chs_arc_dilemma_slayer_kings	U'zhul's Fate	Release me from this steel thralldom, Everchosen, so that I may kill for mighty Khorne once more.

You swore!	vco_archaon_dilemma	false	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_chs_aza_dilemma_supplicants_come	The Supplicants Come	Within his Dark Fortress, the Prince of Damnation reigns over his Ecstatic Legions.

vco_chs_fes_dilemma_lustrian_plague	The Lustrian Plague	Upon delivery of the ingredients, the sickly rat lowers his hood, revealing a ravaged visage of dripping buboes and a pair of hollow eye sockets.

vco_chs_vil_dilemma_the_reckoning	The Reckoning	The Everchosen steps into Vilitch's path, sword drawn. The Puppets of Misrule converge on the new threat, moving in perfect unison, but the Curseling raises a single hand, and they all stop dead in their tracks.\\n\\n"What did I swear to you, Sorcerer, when last we met?" asked Archaon.\\n\\n"That there would be a reckoning," Vilitch replied, and then laughed. "And you were right."\\n\\nA shadow fell over the pair as a great Lord of Change descended from on high, cackling mirthlessly.\\n\\n"Sarthorael..." Archaon growled. "If you think this feathered fool will save you, Curseling, you are sorely mistaken."\\n\\nVilitch cackled and raised his hand to the sky. Mannslieb disappeared in a whisp of smoke, revealing itself to be merely an illusion. In its place shone the Chaos moon, Morrslieb, bathing the world in its sickly green hue.\\n\\n"Gaze into the Eye of Sheerian, Three-Eyed King," Sarthoreal crowed, "and behold your fate."	vco_vilitch_dilemma	false	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false

vco_dwf_gro_dilemma_elves	The Fate of the Elves	Malekith is dead, turned to stone by Grungi's judgment. The dead have been avenged, but there are still foes out in the world.

vco_ksl_kat_dilemma_call_for_aid	A Call For Aid	Though hordes of savage Chaos worshippers have been put to route, countless more descend from the north, held at bay only by the blood and sweat of brave Kislevite stock.
