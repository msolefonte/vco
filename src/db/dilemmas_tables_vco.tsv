vco_brt_alb_dilemma_mananns_favour	The Sea God's Boon	Alberic holds his trident high as the last of the pirates' ships slips beneath the waves. A peal of thunder rings out, and a living mountain of blue-black water rises up out of the ocean, coalescing into the semblance of a huge man. With a booming voice, it declares that Manann wishes to grant the Bretonnians a boon.	vco_alberic_dilemma	false	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_chs_arc_dilemma_slayer_kings	U'zhul's Fate	Release me from this steel thralldom, Everchosen, so that I may kill for mighty Khorne once more. To taste the blood he spills, rather than watch it drip down the walls of my prison. To wield, and not be wielded. You swore I would be free! You swore!	vco_archaon_dilemma	false	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_cth_miao_dilemma_sister_rescued	Hope Springs Eternal	As the final Cultist is torn away screaming from his altar, a blinding, brilliant light bursts forth from deep within the Dark Fortress. Scores of daemons are incinerated on the spot, and northmen run for their lives as the whole structure collapses. A radiant dragon emerges from the ruin in a spray of shattered masonry. It is Miao's sister, Shen-Zoo, found at last!	vco_miao_dilemma	false	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_dwf_gro_dilemma_elves	The Fate of the Elves	Malekith is dead, turned to stone by Grungi's judgment. The dead have been avenged, but there are still foes out in the world. The Karaz Ankor still have need of the White Dwarf. The time has come for Grombindal to decide the fate of the Elgi race. Should the War of Vengeance begin again, or should peace reign?	vco_grombrindal_dilemma	false	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_ksl_kat_dilemma_call_for_aid	A Call For Aid	Though hordes of savage Chaos worshippers have been put to route, countless more descend from the north, held at bay only by the blood and sweat of brave Kislevite stock. The End Times approach, and the Ice Queen knows that the wars to come cannot be fought alone. Her finest diplomats have been summoned to the palace, but who should they petition?	vco_katarin_dilemma	false	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_vmp_man_dilemma_ossified_portal	The Ossified Portal	Mannfred raises the Timor Noctis towards the fell moon shining balefully over the desert. He chants sonorously as the blade glows with power, an unholy dirge that fuses the bones of a dozen conquered Tomb Kings into a great ossified portal that thrums with Dhar magic. The way to Sylvania is open.	vco_mannfred_dilemma	false	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_skv_mdr_dilemma_ultimate_harvest	Twisted Pleasures	With the destruction of the Elven waystones, Ariel was forced to use all her strength keeping the portal to the Dreaming Wood contained. In her weakened state, she could not repel the teeming hordes of Clan Moulder who ambushed her in the Witchwood. She was bound in shackles made of purest warpstone and delivered to Throt's Flesh Labs, where she met a most painful end...	vco_throt_dilemma	false	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
