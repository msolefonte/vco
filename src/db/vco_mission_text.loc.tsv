mission_text_text_vco_tmb_ark_1_thy_kingdom_come	<dummy>Arkhan has feigned obedience to Settra for long enough. The time has come to march out and retake the ancient lands of his master, the Great Necromancer Nagash.	true
mission_text_text_vco_tmb_ark_2_born_to_serve	<dummy>The vampires did not drink from the Elixir of Life as Arkhan did, but from a lesser, corrupted version that cursed them with unlife. They are forever bound to the will of Nagash, and as his foremost servant, Arkhan can command them just as easily.	true
mission_text_text_vco_tmb_ark_2_born_to_serve_region_overwrite	Control at least 4 of the following regions either by direct ownership or through [[img:icon_vassal]][[/img]]vassals and [[img:icon_military_alliance]][[/img]]military allies:	true
mission_text_text_vco_tmb_ark_3_faithful_servant	<dummy>The portents are troubled. Daemons roam the earth. Ancient empires crumble before the coming of Chaos. Preparations must be made for the Great Necromancer's return.	true
mission_text_text_vco_tze_kai_1_great_game	<dummy>Tzeentch's ultimate goal is utterly unknowable. Perhaps the Great Game and even the destruction of the Old World are merely amusing diversions for the Great Schemer. The realisation of his greater plan, if he has one, is lost in the mists of the far future.	true
mission_text_text_vco_tze_kai_2_visions_past	<dummy>The Fateweaver gazes back into the past, witnessing his past self breach the magical barriers of the Lizardmen's temple-cities. He saw with only one pair of eyes back then, and thus was blind to his imminent defeat. This time, history will not repeat itself...	true
mission_text_text_vco_tze_kai_3_visions_future	<dummy>The Fateweaver casts his mind forward and beholds a grim future. The Elves, Dwarfs and Lizardmen march together as one in an unstoppable alliance, united by the machinations of an Elven wizard within the halls of a golden dwarfhold. But to Kairos, fate is as malleable as clay. He will ensure such an eventuality does not come to pass.	true
mission_text_text_vco_vmp_man_1_restless_dunes	<dummy>The shifting sands of Nehekhara hide many long lost tombs filled with powerful magical artifacts that Mannfred desires. They also hide many foes who would see him undone. They will find only death and an unlife of eternal servitude in these dunes.	true
mission_text_text_vco_vmp_man_2_reclaim_throne	<dummy>The time has come to return to Sylvania and reclaim the von Carstein's ancestral citadel: Castle Drakenhof. In his private chambers in the uppermost tower Mannfred can continue to study the Books of Nagash he has found thus far. But first, Vlad and Isabella must be convinced to recognise his supremacy, or else be staked through the heart and left out for dawn's light to take them.	true
mission_text_text_vco_vmp_man_3_death_comes_for_all	<dummy>Mannfred means to marshal every last vestige of the Great Necromancer's power and launch an unholy assault upon the Empire. The reign of the Midnight Aristocracy is nigh...	true
mission_text_text_vco_wef_twi_1_dreaming_wood_1	<dummy>In the forests of Naggaroth, a portal to the Dreaming Wood grows thin; where beyond, Daemon's rage. Only Ariel can seal the dire portal, but to do so she must draw strength from the Worldroots. Should she fail, the portal will carry the Daemons to the very heart of Athel Loren!	true
mission_text_text_vco_wef_twi_1_dreaming_wood_2	<dummy>The Hag Queen's machinations have brought Athel Loren to the brink of ruin over the centuries. Even now, she means to use the portal to the Dreaming Wood to usher in the daemonic armies of her Dark Prince. Her scheming must end.	true
mission_text_text_vco_wef_twi_2_vauls_anvils	<dummy>Some whisper that Lord Daith is older even than Ariel and Orion, that he fled Ulthuan with the first colonists; others claim that he is Vaul himself, the Elven God of Smiths who crafted the Widowmaker with the heat of Draugnir's flames. Despite Naestra's protestations, Arahan once brazenly asked the blind smith if this was true. He merely chuckled before returning to the fires of his forge.	true
mission_text_text_vco_wef_twi_3_sacred_pools_1	<dummy>A single, enormous Zoat emerges from the Worldroots and kneels before the Mage Queen, pledging his herd's allegiance to the Woodland Realms. The ancient being claims the Sacred Pools are under threat by invaders from across the sea who chop and burn the woods without remorse. Riled, Ariel sends her Heralds to chasten the impudent mayflies.	true
mission_text_text_vco_wef_twi_3_sacred_pools_2	<dummy>Alarielle, Everqueen of the High Elves and Chosen of Isha, has safeguarded the forests of Avelorn for centuries. Now, she must make the final sacrifice and give both her body and soul to the Oaken Throne, where she will reign over a new Woodland Realm in the heart of Ulthuan. Alas, she will not do so willingly. She is ignorant of Isha's designs for her, and Ariel's Heralds, regrettably, must persuade her to see reason.	true
mission_text_text_vco_def_gan_1_sacrifice_slaughter	<dummy>Nagarythe has stood too long, and Khaine hungers for the blood of the Revenant. The Shadow King is close, and what a glorious sacrifice his body would be upon the very shrine itself.	true
mission_text_text_vco_def_gan_2_suffer_not_another_queen	 <dummy>There shall be one queen, and it shall be I, Blood Queen of Khaine. Slay the Everqueen. Raid Elven holds and enslave the survivors... But leave a few alive to spread the news. Return only when their lands lie bare; your palace awaits, where the sacrifices will be many, gory, and beautiful.	true
mission_text_text_vco_def_gan_3_eternity_awaits	<dummy>Morathi has spurned you too many times. She has long denied you access to the Cauldrons of Blood, and the eternal youth within them, but no more.	true
