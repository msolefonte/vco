vco_brt_alb_dilemma_mananns_favour	false	Alberic holds his trident high as the last of the pirates' ships slips beneath the waves. A peal of thunder rings out, and a living mountain of blue-black water rises up out of the ocean, coalescing into the semblance of a huge man. With a booming voice, it declares that Manann wishes to grant the Bretonnians a boon.	The Sea God's Boon	vco_alberic_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_brt_rep_dilemma_eternal_war	false	As Repanse de Lyonesse and her faithful protector, Henri le Massif, tour the newly liberated lands, they find themselves at a crossroads. Though the Undead have been vanquished in Nehekera, they are still surrounded by the forces of evil. To the south, strange reptiles and teeming hordes of vermin infest the jungles. To the north, the Greenskins rule the Badlands. Which foe should face the Lady's holy wrath?	The Eternal Errantry War	vco_repanse_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_bst_mal_dilemma_harbinger	false	Amid a thunder of black wings a bestial figure descended from on high and unleashed lancing beams of amber fire upon the terrified soldiers beneath him. Beastmen emerged from the forests, and unholy winged creatures descended from the sky, and soon the battle was won. The Cult of Sigmar's mighty coalition splintered into a series of disparate warbands soon thereafter. Malagor would make an example out of one of them. The rest would be food for the crows...	Prophecy Fulfilled	vco_malagor_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_chd_ast_dilemma_old_foe	false	As the Disciples of Hashut did battle with the teeming masses of Greenskins arrayed before them, one among their number levelled their axe directly at Astragoth in challenge. It was none other than the infamous Black Orc Warlord, Grimgor. Ironhand and Ironhide strove against each other for hours, but eventually Astragoth emerged the victor. Grimgor's fate is now in his hands...	An Old Foe Returns	vco_astragoth_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_chd_dra_dilemma_witch_kings_gift	false	The warfleet steamed forth into the Jade Sea, intent on raiding Cathay’s eastern coast. As luck would have it, they intercepted the Black Ark “Joyous Desolation” en route back to Naggarond, its hold brimming with slaves and plunder. After a furious battle, the ship was boarded and its crew slain. All that remains is to decide the fate of the chattel within.	The Witch King’s Gift	vco_drazhoath_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_chd_zha_dilemma_marcher_fortress	false	A hail of rocketfire blasted the battlements of the Marcher Fortress to ruin, and the Warhost of Zharr stormed into the breach. Great was the bloodshed on both sides, but, inevitably, Zhatan’s forces emerged victorious, and the garrison was slaughtered. Zhatan barks out an order to begin pillaging the stronghold’s vast arsenal, but time is of the essence. Even now, the Dark Prince’s daemon hordes muster to retake the fortress. What weaponry should the convoys prioritise loading?	The Marcher Fortress Arsenal	vco_zhatan_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_chs_arc_dilemma_slayer_kings	false	Release me from this steel thralldom, Everchosen, so that I may kill for mighty Khorne once more. To taste the blood he spills, rather than watch it drip down the walls of my prison. To wield, and not be wielded. You swore I would be free! You swore!	U'zhul's Fate	vco_archaon_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_chs_aza_dilemma_supplicants_come	false	Within his Dark Fortress, the Prince of Damnation reigns over his Ecstatic Legions. As his latest subjects come to grovel at his feet, Azazel is momentarily roused from his indolent stupour. These great champions of the Old World will surely provide him with some amusement. Indulge one of them, and let the others wallow in despair.	The Supplicants Come	vco_azazel_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_chs_bel_dilemma_aetherophasic_engine	false	At last, Be'lakor's greatest creation is ready. The Aetherophasic Engine is a twisted fusion of flesh and metal, powered by thousands of tortured souls. Its purpose: to forcibly bend an entire nation of mortals to the Dark Master's will. There is only one matter left to attend to: the target.	The Aetherophasic Engine	vco_belakor_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_chs_fes_dilemma_lustrian_plague	false	Upon delivery of the ingredients, the sickly rat lowers his hood, revealing a ravaged visage of dripping buboes and a pair of hollow eye sockets. It is none other than Lord Skrolk, the Disease-That-Walks. He claims that Clan Pestilens is now ready to unleash a new plague upon the Old World, but seeks your advice on how best to administer it to the population.	The Lustrian Plague	vco_festus_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_chs_val_dilemma_nkari_approaches	false	Despite N'Kari's treacherous magic, and Locephax's inane mutterings, the Keeper of Secrets is bested once more. N'kari falls to his knees, bartering for his life. He promises endless pleasures of the flesh, great feast halls filled with exotic foods, vast treasure hoards of gleaming gold and glittering gemstones. How best to reply?	The Arch-Tempter's Plea	vco_valkia_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_chs_vil_dilemma_the_reckoning	false	The Everchosen steps into Vilitch's path, sword drawn. The Puppets of Misrule converge on the new threat, moving in perfect unison, but the Curseling raises a single hand, and they all stop dead in their tracks.\\n\\n"What did I swear to you, Sorcerer, when last we met?" asked Archaon.\\n\\n"That there would be a reckoning," Vilitch replied, and then laughed. "And you were right."\\n\\nA shadow fell over the pair as a great Lord of Change descended from on high, cackling mirthlessly.\\n\\n"Sarthorael..." Archaon growled. "If you think this feathered fool will save you, Curseling, you are sorely mistaken."\\n\\nVilitch cackled and raised his hand to the sky. Mannslieb disappeared in a whisp of smoke, revealing itself to be merely an illusion. In its place shone the Chaos moon, Morrslieb, bathing the world in its sickly green hue.\\n\\n"Gaze into the Eye of Sheerian, Three-Eyed King," Sarthoreal crowed, "and behold your fate."	The Reckoning	vco_vilitch_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_cst_cyl_dilemma_finest_hour	false	King Finubar and his court are in their seats. The stage is set. Zombified performers, musicians and stagehands are all in their places. The curtain rises, and Cylostra sweeps onto the stage. There is only one matter left to attend to. Which performance should she give?	Cylostra's Finest Hour	vco_cylostra_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_cth_miao_dilemma_sister_rescued	false	As the final Cultist is torn away screaming from his altar, a blinding, brilliant light bursts forth from deep within the Dark Fortress. Scores of daemons are incinerated on the spot, and northmen run for their lives as the whole structure collapses. A radiant dragon emerges from the ruin in a spray of shattered masonry. It is Miao's sister, Shen-Zoo, found at last!	Hope Springs Eternal	vco_miao_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_dwf_gro_dilemma_elves	false	Malekith is dead, turned to stone by Grungi's judgment. The dead have been avenged, but there are still foes out in the world. The Karaz Ankor still have need of the White Dwarf. The time has come for Grombindal to decide the fate of the Elgi race. Should the War of Vengeance begin again, or should peace reign?	The Fate of the Elves	vco_grombrindal_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_emp_mar_dilemma_hunting_trophy	false	The Huntsmarshal has led his men all across Lustria, slaughtering scores of fearsome beasts in Sigmar’s name and amassing a staggering array of hunting trophies which are now on display within the conquered temple-city of Tlaxtlan. A delegation from Altdorf will soon arrive to tour the city, and thus an opportunity to garner further support abroad presents itself. Which beast should serve as the centrepiece to this grand exhibit?	The Huntsmarshal’s Trophy Hall	vco_markus_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_emp_vol_dilemma_final_seal	false	Commoners line the streets as Volkmar's procession makes its way through Altdorf to the Holy Temple of Sigmar. Templars of the Fiery Heart, Sigmar's Blood and Knights Griffon come to pay their respects to the Grand Theogonist's triumphant return. Volkmar descends into the vaults of the temple, followed by a cadre of Warrior Priests, and seals the Books of Nagash away for all time.	Triumphant Return	vco_volkmar_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_ksl_kat_dilemma_call_for_aid	false	Though hordes of savage Chaos worshippers have been put to route, countless more descend from the north, held at bay only by the blood and sweat of brave Kislevite stock. The End Times approach, and the Ice Queen knows that the wars to come cannot be fought alone. Her finest diplomats have been summoned to the palace, but who should they petition?	A Call For Aid	vco_katarin_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_lzd_maz_dilemma_unity_spirit	false	With the Geomantic Web restored, Slann Mage-Priests long separated from the mainland hold councils of sublime communion with Lord Mazdamundi. He warns his kin of the impending approach of the Ancient Enemy, and all come to the agreement that his interpretation of the Great Plan is without error. The Lizardmen must unite under one banner.	Unity of Spirit	vco_mazdamundi_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_lzd_nak_dilemma_wu_xing_compass	false	Across Cathay, the leylines surge with renewed energy. Yet all is not as it was. There is a strange abberation affecting the flow of Geomantic magic in these lands. The Mage Priests inform the Wanderer that it is the arcane object known as the Wu Xing Compass that is the cause of this distortion. The warmbloods and their draconic masters now stand in direct opposition of the Great Plan. How should they be dealt with?	The Wu Xing Compass	vco_nakai_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_skv_mdr_dilemma_ultimate_harvest	false	With the destruction of the Elven waystones, Ariel was forced to use all her strength keeping the portal to the Dreaming Wood contained. In her weakened state, she could not repel the teeming hordes of Clan Moulder who ambushed her in the Witchwood. She was bound in shackles made of purest warpstone and delivered to Throt's Flesh Labs, where she met a most painful end...	Twisted Pleasures	vco_throt_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_skv_tre_dilemma_ambush_everpeak	false	Skreet Blackblade, right-claw to the Supreme Warlord of Clan Rictus, journeyed to the Everpeak to “congratulate” Tretch in person for his momentous victory.\\n\\nUnfortunately for Skreet, his clawpack collided with a throng of vengeful Dwarfs from the Grey Mountains, who had arrived far too late to lend aid to their kin of the east. The battle was frantic and bloody, for both sides had not expected to meet the other. Quite an unfortunate series of events, for which the Craventail surely played no part!\\n\\nThe wily Chieftain watched the battle play out, concealed within a cluster of stalactites on the underway's ceiling. When the bloodshed neared his end, he flicked his bladed tail in a complicated gesture, the glint of its keen edge visible to his raiders far below even in the deep gloom of the cavern.\\n\\nWith the signal given, the raiders sprung into action, slaughtering Dwarf and Skaven survivor alike. Only Skreet was spared... spared long enough to beg for his life at the feet of the Craventail. Tretch's tail sliced through the air, and the right-claw's head toppled from his shoulders. Then... the feasting began.\\n\\nKratch Doomclaw, Supreme Warlord of Clan Rictus, is certain to be displeased at this outcome. How should this situation be resolved?	Ambush at the Everpeak	vco_tretch_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_vmp_hel_dilemma_dark_bargain	false	As Helman speaks the last word of the incantation, the Darkforged Vessel shudders violently, and the blood and bone within coalesce into the ghastly appearance of a skinless head. The entity speaks, claiming to be an envoy of an entity known only as Malal. It claims Helman’s brothers do not wish to return to the world of the living, but instead wish to be free of their eternal servitude. It offers to guide them safely to the Gardens of Morr, but this offer comes at a cost: Helman's soul.	Dark Bargain	vco_helman_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
vco_vmp_man_dilemma_ossified_portal	false	Mannfred raises the Timor Noctis towards the fell moon shining balefully over the desert. He chants sonorously as the blade glows with power, an unholy dirge that fuses the bones of a dozen conquered Tomb Kings into a great ossified portal that thrums with Dhar magic. The way to Sylvania is open.	The Ossified Portal	vco_mannfred_dilemma	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
