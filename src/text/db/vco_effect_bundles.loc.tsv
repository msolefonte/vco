A single cough can lay low a legendary hero where feats of arms have failed. A sneeze can decimate an entire town.

effect_bundles_localised_description_vco_victory_payload_nur_kug_3_death_dwarfs	Ku'gath once spent several centuries within the Forge of Souls as punishment for his failure against the Dwarfs.
