missions_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_tretch	A large pillar of dark-green light pulses forth from the Tower of Gorgoth and smashes into the Chaos Moon. Tidal waves of entropic energy pulse through the atmosphere, and Morskrit disgorges its precious gifts. Tretch groans with frustration as the shower of meteors crashes somewhere far to the north, well away from the slopes of Crookback Mountain, as promised. Cursing the Grey Seers for their incompetence, Tretch gathers his raiders and sets out to claim the precious warpstone before someone else gets to it first.	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_vco_tretch_battle_warpstone_meteor	Curses! Vampires from the Silver Pinnacle have reached the impact crater of what has to be one of the largest warpstone meteors Tretch has ever seen. No doubt they seek to harvest the precious substance for some unholy spell. Unacceptable! With a slash of his tail, Tretch orders his Stormvermin forward. The dead will know to fear Clan Rictus, yes-yes!	false
