For too long she has safeguarded the Great Bastion, repelling countless incursions, yet denied every chance at reprisal.

In the years since that bargain was struck, Greasus has risen to the rank of Overtyrant - leader of the Ogre Kingdoms, and his tolls have become increasingly exorbitant. The Iron Dragon must rein in the gluttonous Ogre's excesses, or else abandon all pretenses of diplomacy and secure the Ivory Road by force of arms.	true

mission_text_text_vco_dwf_gro_2_high_elf_decision	<dummy>Fell forces now gather against Elves and Dwarfs. Malekith, embittered by his maiming in the Flame of Asuryan, seeks to destroy them both, but still darker powers are also at work.

mission_text_text_vco_kho_ska_2_blood_god_roc	<dummy>Though Khorne cares not from whence the blood flows, the tainted blood of Vampires is much sought after by his mortal followers, Minotaurs in particular.

mission_text_text_vco_nur_kug_1_great_game	<dummy>The Plague Lord, obsessed with his ceaseless foetid experiments, seems to care little about the Great Game. Yet his carefree demeanour subtly undermines the plotting and politicking of the other Chaos Gods. It drives Khorne to an unthinking fury, disturbs Tzeentch's insidious train of thought, and distracts Slaanesh from his indulgences.

Embrace war as the crucible of your valediction, the means to purge this stain upon our people. Swear oaths of vengeance, not to me or your companions or to the uncaring gods, but to fallen mothers and fathers, dead sisters and brothers, slain sons and daughters. Take the darkness that the Druchii have created and rob them of its power.”	false

Standing atop his Oathstone, he declares to all his kin that he would rather die in exile than see another hold suffer the same fate of Vala-Azril-Ungol. With hammer and shield, he swears to bring ruin to all who would threaten their people.	false

Belegar Ironhammer, clan leader and direct descendant of King Lunn, the last Dwarf to rule the ancestral hold, has inherited a bitter legacy of hatred and resentment. Even now he marshals his throng, making ready to strike out from Zarakzil. With the spirits of his fabled ancestors returned to fight by his side, Belegar will see his oaths fulfilled, and pass into legend himself.	false

Unfortunately, in his absence, his treacherous subordinates have claimed the [[col:yellow]]Eight Peaks[[/col]] as their own. Worse still, rumour has it that stinking stunties and ratties have their sights set on the hold too! This won't do.
